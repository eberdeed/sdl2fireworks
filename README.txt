    sdl2fireworks is a program that displays a fireworks
    display with sound.  The keys are as follows.
    a right
    s back
    d left
    w forward
    r up
    f down
    x reverse view.
    z reset view.
    Escape ends the program.
    Alt+Return sets full screen.
    Up arrow zooms in.
    Down arrow zooms out.
    
    To compile the program you will need the following libraries:
    FreeImage, GLEW, SDL2, boost, pthread and GLM. 
    You must also have cmake.
    The commands are:
    
    cd build
    cmake ..
    sudo make
    sudo make doc
    sudo make install
    
    To run the program:
    
    sdl2fireworks
    
    The documentation is located in:
    
    /usr/share/doc/sdl2fireworks-doc
    
    The sources I used to educate myself concerning OpenGL are
    as follows:
        "OpenGL ES 3.0 Programming Guide Second Edition" 
    by Dan Ginsburg and Budirijanto Purnomo published by Addison-Wesley 2014.
        www.learnopengl.com.
    GLEW http://glew.sourceforge.net, and
    CMAKE www.cmake.org.
    SDL2 https://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage
    pthread https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/libpthread.html
    OpenGL is generally available on any system as part 
    of the underlying graphics subsystem and GLEW will 
    get you access to it.
    
    Documentation is available after install at:
    
    /usr/share/doc/sdl2fireworks-doc
    
        
    The program was written and compiled on debian linux available at:  www.debian.org.
